# ALX Interview

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of the ALX Interview preparation. Each project focuses on solving specific algorithmic challenges and implementing efficient data processing techniques using Python.

## Projects

### 0x00. Pascal Triangle
- **Description**: Implements a function to return the Pascal's triangle up to a specified number of rows.
- **Key Concepts**: Recursion, list manipulation, combinatorics.

### 0x01. Lockboxes
- **Description**: Solves the lockboxes problem where a series of boxes can be opened using keys contained within other boxes.
- **Key Concepts**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), data structures (lists, sets).

### 0x02. Minimum Operations
- **Description**: Calculates the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a specific goal (e.g., to achieve a number from a given starting point).
- **Key Concepts**: Mathematical operations, optimization algorithms.

### 0x03. Log Parsing
- **Description**: Parses log entries from standard input, validates their format, and computes relevant statistics (e.g., total file size, status code counts).
- **Key Concepts**: Regular expressions, signal handling, dictionaries, exception handling.

## Usage
Each project includes a set of Python scripts that can be executed directly or imported as modules. Detailed instructions and examples are provided in the individual project directories.

## Requirements
- Python 3.4.3 or later
- Adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines
